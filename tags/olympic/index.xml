      <description>We didnt have time to finish this task during the game since we decided to finish Freestyle 400 (scored in the last minute) but as I foound out later, we were close to finish it.
In this level we were presented with a login form vulnerable to user enumeration. It was easy to see that admin was a valid user but we could not guess the password. After trying with other &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; accounts like guest, dev and so on, we found that debug was a valid account and the password was debug.</description>
