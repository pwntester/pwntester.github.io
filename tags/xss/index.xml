      <description>Web 100: Abitol This is a simple web app where you can register and login to see an articles page, a photo gallery, a flag page and an admin contact page.
Visiting the flag page give us a Nice try, did you really think it would be that easy? ;) but the photo gallery is vulnerable to XSS:
http://abitbol.nuitduhack.com/zoom.php?image=1%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E
Now, we dont know how the admin contact will be visualized in the viewer page, but we can try to send him a message with an iframe pointing to the vulnerable page so we can send his session ID to our cookie catcher or use XHR to request the flag.</description>

      <description>These are my solutions to Erling Ellingsen escape.alf.nu XSS challenges. I found them very interesting and I learnt a lot from them (especially from the last ones published in this post). Im publishing my results since the game has been online for a long time now and there are already some sites with partial results.
My suggestion, if you havent done it so far, is to go and try to solve them by yourselves&amp;hellip;.</description>
