      <description>I did not solve this level during the CTF, but found it so interesting reading Xelenonz write-up that I couldnt help trying it myself just for the fun and since this blog is my personal notes, I decided to write it here for future reference, but all credits go to Xelenonz.
We are given the code of a Image hostig web app. Reading the code we see how it handle the requests:</description>

      <description>Continuing my previous post where I mentioned that the XStream RCE issue issue also affected SpringMVC RESTful WebServices using the XStream SpringOXM wrapper, I wanted to share a POC server. The code is quite simple and can be found in the XStreamServer GitHub Repo. It contains a WebService defined by the ContactController:
@Controller @RequestMapping(&amp;quot;/contacts&amp;quot;) public class ContactController { @Autowired private ContactRepository contactRepository; @RequestMapping( value = &amp;quot;/{id}&amp;quot;, method = RequestMethod.GET ) @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.</description>

      <description>When researching SpringMVC RESTful APIs and their XXE vulnerabilities I found that XStream was not vulnerable to XXE because it ignored the &amp;lt;DOCTYPE /&amp;gt; blocks. Curious about it I decided to took a deeper look at XStream and found out that its not just a simple marshalling library as JAXB but a much more powerful serializing library capable of serializing to an XML representation really complex types and not just POJOs.</description>
