      <description>These are my solutions to Erling Ellingsen escape.alf.nu XSS challenges. I found them very interesting and I learnt a lot from them (especially from the last ones published in this post). Im publishing my results since the game has been online for a long time now and there are already some sites with partial results.
My suggestion, if you havent done it so far, is to go and try to solve them by yourselves&amp;hellip;.</description>
